**Creating a Serverless Application with AWS Lambda**

This project demonstrates the creation of a serverless application using AWS Lambda. The goal is to provide an understanding of serverless computing and how to build applications without the need to manage servers.

Project Description

In this project, you will learn how to create a serverless application on AWS through the following steps:

**Step 1: Setting Up AWS Lambda Function**

1.Login and Access AWS Lambda:

Sign into the AWS Management Console.

Navigate to the AWS Lambda service.

2.Create a New Lambda Function:

Click "Create function" and select "Author from scratch."

Name your function and choose a runtime environment (e.g., Node.js, Python).

Configure the function permissions by attaching a new role with basic Lambda execution permissions.

Click "Create function" to finalize the setup.

**Step 2: Develop and Deploy Lambda Function Code**

1.Code Implementation:

Use the built-in code editor or upload a .zip file containing your code.

Configure the function's handler and runtime settings accordingly.

2.Deployment:

Click "Deploy" to save and deploy the function code.

**Step 3: Configure API Gateway**

1.Create an API:

Navigate to the API Gateway service.

Select "Create API" and choose either "HTTP API" or "REST API" as per your application needs.

2.Define Routes and Methods:

Set up routes and HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).

Link the API routes to the corresponding Lambda function using the function's ARN.

3.Deploy the API:

Deploy the API and obtain the endpoint URL.

**Step 4: Test and Validate**

1.Testing with Postman or cURL:

Send HTTP requests to the API endpoint using tools like Postman or cURL.

Confirm that the Lambda function is invoked and responds correctly.

**Step 5: Monitor and Optimize**

1.Utilize CloudWatch:

Navigate to CloudWatch to monitor Lambda function performance.

Review logs, create alarms, and analyze performance metrics.

Optimize the function's performance based on insights gathered.

**Technologies Used**
 
 Amazon Web Services (AWS)
 
Lambda

API Gateway

CloudWatch

**Conclusion**

This project provides a comprehensive guide to building a serverless application with AWS Lambda. It offers practical experience in developing, deploying, and managing serverless functions, along with API integration. This serves as a foundational project for anyone looking to delve into serverless architectures and cloud-native application development.
